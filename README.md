# Idea Bucket

Welcome to Idea Bucket! This is a collaborative platform for collecting and rating project/business ideas. The goal is to foster creativity, collaboration, and innovation. Use the ICE framework (Impact, Confidence, and Ease) to evaluate and prioritize ideas effectively.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new folder for your idea
2. Create 2 files (ideally as Markdown ```.md```):
   - Description
   - Rating
3. Provide a clear and concise title for your idea.
4. Describe the idea in detail, including its purpose and potential impact.
5. Use the ICE framework to rate your idea:
   - **Impact**: How much impact can this idea have?
   - **Confidence**: How confident are you in the success of this idea?
   - **Ease**: How easy or difficult would it be to implement this idea?
6. If you have no idea how to rate it copy and paste this with your project description into ChatGPT:

   ``` ChatGPT
   Give me an example of a ICE framework score for my project idea: [ENTER YOUR PROJECT IDEA HERE]
   ```
   

## The ICE Framework

When submitting and evaluating project/business ideas within Idea Bucket, we use the ICE framework to assess and prioritize ideas effectively. The ICE framework consists of three key components:

### 1. Impact

**Definition:** Impact refers to the potential positive outcomes and benefits that the idea can bring.

**Considerations:**
- How much positive change or improvement can this idea bring about?
- What is the potential reach and significance of the idea?

### 2. Confidence

**Definition:** Confidence represents the level of certainty or belief in the success of the idea.

**Considerations:**
- How confident are you in the feasibility and viability of this idea?
- Have you considered potential challenges and mitigations?

### 3. Ease

**Definition:** Ease refers to the level of difficulty or simplicity in implementing the idea.

**Considerations:**
- How easy or challenging would it be to turn this idea into a reality?
- Are there existing resources or expertise that can facilitate implementation?

## How to Use the ICE Framework

When submitting or rating an idea, consider each of the three componentsâ€”Impact, Confidence, and Easeâ€”and assign a numerical score or rank to each. This helps in objectively evaluating and prioritizing ideas within the Idea Bucket community.

For example:
- Impact: 8/10
- Confidence: 7/10
- Ease: 5/10

Feel free to use the ICE framework to provide structured feedback on ideas, facilitating meaningful discussions and decision-making within our collaborative community.
